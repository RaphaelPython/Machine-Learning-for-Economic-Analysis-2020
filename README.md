# Machine Learning for Economic Analysis 2020

Material for the course by Damian Kozbur @UZH. The primary reference for introductory machine learning concepts and econometrics is Gareth James, Daniela Witten, Trevor Hastie, Robert Tibshirani, “An Introduction to Statistical Learning with Applications in R”, freely available [here](https://faculty.marshall.usc.edu/gareth-james/ISL/ISLR%20Seventh%20Printing.pdf).

The softwares used in the lectures are [Matlab](https://www.mathworks.com/products/matlab.html) and [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). A strongly recommended research is the documentation of the Python library [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/).
